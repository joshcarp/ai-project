# The report

Finally, you must discuss the strategic and algorithmic aspects of your game-playing program and the techniques you have applied in a separate file called report.pdf.
This report is your opportunity to highlight your application of techniques discussed in class and beyond, and to demonstrate the most impressive aspects of your project work.

# 3.1 Report structure

You may choose any high-level structure of your report. Aim to present your work in a logical way, using sections with clear titles separating different topics of discussion.
Here are some suggestions for topics you might like to include in your report. Note: Not all of these topics or questions will be applicable to your project, depending on your approach. That’s completely normal. You should focus on the topics which make sense for you and your work. Also, if you have other topics to discuss beyond those listed here, feel free to include them.
• Describe your approach: How does your game-playing program select actions throughout the game?

Example questions: What search algorithm have you chosen, and why? Have you made any modi- fications to an existing algorithm? What are the features of your evaluation function, and what are their strategic motivations? If you have applied machine learning, how does this fit into your overall approach? What learning methodology have you followed, and why? (Note that it is not essential to use machine learning to design a strong player)
• Performance evaluation: How effective is your game-playing program?

Example questions: How have you judged your program’s performance? Have you compared multiple
programs based on different approaches, and, if so, how have you selected which is the most effective?
• Other aspects: Are there any other important creative or technical aspects of your work?

Examples: algorithmic optimisations, specialised data structures, any other significant efficiency opti- misations, alternative or enhanced algorithms beyond those discussed in class, or any other significant ideas you have incorporated from your independent research.
• Supporting work: Have you completed any other work to assist you in the process of developing your game-playing program?
